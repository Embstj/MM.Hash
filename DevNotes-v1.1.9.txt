Dev Notes v1.1.9.txt

-Improved Benchmarking system. System should not correctly back up coins, and should do so with little to no errors.

-Fixed Wallet-Tracker. I accidentally left test wallet inside, instead of replacing with array. Repaired. It should work now.

-Added Pool to Wallet-Tracker. Added option to specify pools for coin mining. Can use multiple pools.

-Added 11 coins total to miner files

-HUGE UNIX PATCH:

v1.1.9 should finally resolve all Unix mining erorrs, and process ID tracking, which led to weird issues with
miner. I have improved the actual process logic tree, and ensured that processes as they closed are forced $null.
I have also removed KlausT Windows from Miner files, added KlausT Linux. I added a new way to build miners-
Linux-Zip-Build, which downloads a release rather then cloning from github, then compiles miner to cude 9.1.
I have also repaired benchmarking dramatically, including ensure the miner checks to see if files are actually
written.

-Rolled back z-enemy to 1.10...Miner was crashing, and getting better hashrate.

-Windows

Improved Benchmarking System. Added Miner for LUX when it is able to be mined. Added new argument to 
Wallet_Tracker.bat.

Both Distrubutions:
