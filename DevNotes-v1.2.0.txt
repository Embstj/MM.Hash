v1.2.0 is mainly a patch to repair bugs.

-Fixed Windows JayDDee so it will save benchmarks
-Fixed various typos found in MM.Coin & MM.CoinW
-Made timeout files in Backup say TIMEOUT so it is a little more easier to identify
-Migrated Extra Scripts To Apps folder to clean up clutter
-Began Staging for 24_hr data: The theory is miner will start recording Pool Hash rate, so it can
use currency 24hr price to determine the previous 24 hour profit-per-Hash
-Began Staging for Coin-Parameter update: I intend to no longer have to write coins in miner files.
My goal is to make it so that you only need to add your optimizations (intensity, etc) for algos,
and the miner will determine coins to mine through pool.

Generally Speaking, this was a quick maitenence update after last update which didn't go so well, and a little
project cleanup.
